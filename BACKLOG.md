# Backlog

Tracked feature backlog for `orcid-biosketch`. Every item has a stable ID, an
explicit status, and a revision history. Status changes are appended to the
[Change log](#change-log) at the bottom of this file rather than overwritten, so
the evolution of the backlog stays auditable in the same way generated outputs
are: **the git history is the record, this file is the index.**

## Conventions

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **ID** | Stable identifier. `KF-*` killer features, `FUN-*` playful reuses, `INF-*` infrastructure. IDs are never reused. |
| **Status** | `planned` → `in-progress` → `in-review` → `done`. Also `deferred` and `dropped`. |
| **Priority** | `P0` blocks adoption, `P1` high leverage, `P2` valuable, `P3` opportunistic. |
| **Owner** | Who is implementing. `—` when unclaimed. |
| **Files** | Primary files the item owns, to keep parallel work conflict-free. |

### Design rule (applies to every item)

> ORCID supplies structured assertions; the researcher controls narrative and
> selection.

No item may invent, infer, or rewrite a scientific credential. Enrichment from
non-ORCID sources must be labelled per field with its origin. Playful outputs
(`FUN-*`) are re-presentations of asserted facts only — they never fabricate.

## KF-01 — Complete the ORCID activities surface

- **Priority** P0 · **Status** done · **Owner** agent/core-surface · **Rev** r4
- **Files** `src/orcid_biosketch/core.py`, `schema/biosketch.schema.json`, `tests/`

`build_biosketch` currently reads only `person`, `employments`, `educations` and
`works` from `activities-summary`. The remaining sections are dropped entirely.
Funding and service are what make a document a *biosketch* rather than a
publication list — no funder template can be filled without them.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Parse `fundings`, `peer-reviews`, `distinctions`, `memberships`,
      `services`, `qualifications`, `invited-positions`, `research-resources`.
- [x] `_affiliations()` generalised across the five affiliation-shaped sections.
- [x] Funding retains amount, funder, grant number and external IDs.
- [x] Peer review aggregated per reviewer group with review counts.
- [x] Schema updated; every new section documented and validated.
- [x] Markdown and JSON-LD renderers surface the new sections.
- [ ] Markdown coverage for `qualifications`, `invited_positions` and
      `research_resources` (parsed and exported, not yet rendered).
- [x] Sections absent from a record degrade to empty lists, never `KeyError`.

**Notes** — Peer review is the only machine-readable record of academic
invisible labour that exists anywhere. Surface it prominently.

Landed in `1c04d87`. Peer review nests two levels deep
(`peer-reviews.group[].peer-review-group[].peer-review-summary[]`), unlike
works or affiliations; `research-resource-summary` wraps its content in a
`proposal` object. Both are handled with a fallback to the flatter shape.
**Caveat:** `pub.orcid.org` is unreachable from the build environment, so
the fixture was written from the documented v3.0 schemas and not verified
against a live record — see INF-03.

---

## KF-02 — Full work records via the bulk works endpoint

- **Priority** P0 · **Status** done · **Owner** session · **Rev** r3
- **Files** `src/orcid_biosketch/core.py`
- **Blocked by** INF-01 (retry/backoff needed before multi-request fetching)

`_works()` reads work-summary groups only, so outputs contain **no authors**. A
biosketch whose publications have no author list cannot be pasted into a CV.
`GET /v3.0/{id}/works/{putcodes}` accepts up to 100 comma-separated put-codes
per request and returns contributors, abstract and language.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Batch put-codes 100 at a time; whole record in a small number of requests.
- [x] Contributors normalised to ordered author lists with roles and ORCID iDs.
- [x] Opt-out flag for callers who want the cheap summary-only fetch.
- [x] Degrades to summary data when the detail fetch fails.
- [x] Fetch funding amounts per preferred put-code. Live verification confirmed
      `funding-summary` omits `amount` while `/funding/{put-code}` supplies it.
- [x] Retain every assertion source in a work group so `lint` never mistakes a
      preferred self-assertion for the only assertion.

---

## KF-03 — Citation and funder-format exporters

- **Priority** P0 · **Status** done · **Owner** agent/exporters · **Rev** r4
- **Files** `src/orcid_biosketch/exporters.py` (new), `tests/test_exporters.py`

`render_markdown` is the only renderer. The adoption argument is not "a nicer
web page" — it is removing four hours of formatting the night before a grant
deadline.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] CSL-JSON export, valid against the CSL-JSON item schema.
- [x] BibTeX export with stable, collision-free citation keys and correct escaping.
- [x] RIS export.
- [x] Funder templates (NIH, ERC, Horizon) as data files, not hardcoded, so a
      new format arrives as a contributed template rather than a code change.
- [x] Every exporter is a pure function of the biosketch contract.

**Notes** — CSL type is the single source of truth; BibTeX and RIS map off it.
The template mini-language builds loop scopes from every list-of-dict section in
the contract, so KF-01's new sections render with no code change and a new funder
format really is just a new `.md` file. Authors light up automatically if KF-02
adds them. Wheel build confirmed the templates ship as package data, so no
`pyproject.toml` change was needed.

---

## KF-04 — Per-field enrichment with source labelling

- **Priority** P1 · **Status** planned · **Owner** — · **Rev** r1
- **Files** `src/orcid_biosketch/enrich.py` (new)

Enrichment from OpenAlex/Crossref/DataCite, labelled **per field** rather than
per record, so that ORCID-asserted and externally-derived values remain
distinguishable in the output. This is what keeps the design rule intact once
external data enters the pipeline.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Each enriched value carries its originating source.
- [ ] An ORCID assertion is never overwritten by an external source.
- [ ] Citation counts, open-access status and venue metadata.
- [ ] Retraction check against Crossref / Retraction Watch, surfaced loudly.
- [ ] Fully optional; the tool works offline without it.

---

## KF-05 — `lint`: ORCID record quality report

- **Priority** P1 · **Status** done · **Owner** agent/lint · **Rev** r4
- **Files** `src/orcid_biosketch/lint.py` (new), `tests/test_lint.py`

Score a record and say exactly what to fix. The only item here with standalone
reach: useful to people who will never generate a biosketch, which is precisely
what draws them into the rest of the tool.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Checks: missing DOIs, missing publication dates, missing venue, empty
      biography, no keywords, no funding, orgs lacking ROR/disambiguation,
      self-asserted-only works, duplicate work groups, stale record.
- [x] Weighted score with a documented, reproducible rubric.
- [x] Human-readable report and machine-readable JSON.
- [x] shields.io-compatible badge endpoint JSON for READMEs.
- [x] Non-zero exit under a configurable threshold, for CI use
      (`lint --fail-under N`, landed with INF-02).
- [x] A record with no works cannot earn a passing grade or badge.
- [x] `works.self_asserted` considers every source retained from the ORCID work
      group, not only the preferred summary.

---

**Notes** — Scoring is out of 100 weights, but a check the contract cannot
express is marked not-applicable and subtracted from `max_score` as well as
`score`, so a percentage is never diluted by something unmeasurable. The ROR
check is n/a today because `_affiliations()` emits no organisation identifier;
it lights up on its own once one appears. Duplicate detection is a union-find
over both normalised titles and DOIs, so a manual entry and its Crossref twin
collapse into one group even when only one copy carries the DOI.

Against the committed `generated/biosketch.json`: **86% (B)**, 4 duplicate
groups, 10 self-asserted works, no funding recorded.

---

## KF-06 — Assertion trust layer

- **Priority** P2 · **Status** planned · **Owner** — · **Rev** r1
- **Files** `src/orcid_biosketch/core.py`, `web/orcid-biosketch.js`

`_source()` already captures who asserted each work and nothing downstream uses
it. Render the distinction between self-asserted and publisher/institution-
asserted claims. Near-zero cost, and consistent with the provenance thesis.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Each work classified `self-asserted` / `third-party-asserted`.
- [ ] Trust marker rendered in the web component and the PDF export.
- [ ] Classification logic documented and covered by tests.

---

## KF-07 — Lab / multi-researcher mode

- **Priority** P2 · **Status** planned · **Owner** — · **Rev** r1

One config, N ORCIDs → a team page with deduplicated shared publications and a
collaboration graph. Institutes and labs are the adoption unit; individuals are
a one-person market.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Config accepts a list of ORCID iDs with per-member overrides.
- [ ] Shared publications deduplicated by DOI across members.
- [ ] Team-level JSON contract and web component mode.
- [ ] Sync workflow handles N records within API rate limits.

---

## KF-08 — Change feed and publication Atom feed

- **Priority** P2 · **Status** planned · **Owner** — · **Rev** r1

The README's pitch is that git commits create an auditable history, but nothing
reads that history back. Render it, and the repository becomes subscribable.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` generated from the diff between syncs.
- [ ] Atom feed of new publications.
- [ ] Sync workflow publishes both.

---

## KF-09 — Agent-facing surface

- **Priority** P2 · **Status** planned · **Owner** — · **Rev** r1

An MCP server exposing the biosketch as tools, plus
`/.well-known/researcher.jsonld` and `llms.txt`. The step from
machine-*readable* to machine-*actionable*.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] MCP server with `get_works`, `get_funding`, `find_expertise`.
- [ ] Well-known JSON-LD document emitted alongside generated outputs.
- [ ] `llms.txt` summarising the record for agent consumption.

---

## INF-01 — Fetch robustness, offline input, iD validation

- **Priority** P0 · **Status** done · **Owner** session · **Rev** r3
- **Files** `src/orcid_biosketch/core.py`, `src/orcid_biosketch/cli.py`

`fetch_orcid_record` has no retries, no caching and no rate-limit handling. The
CLI cannot read a saved record from disk — the test suite can, via
`tests/fixture.json`, but users cannot. A mistyped iD becomes a confusing HTTP
error rather than a clear message.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] MOD 11-2 checksum validation of ORCID iDs with a clear error.
- [x] `--record FILE` for offline and CI runs.
- [x] Retry with exponential backoff; explicit rate-limit handling.
- [x] ORCID sandbox base URL supported for contributor testing.
- [x] Network failures produce actionable messages, not tracebacks.

**Notes** — `normalize_orcid()` runs before any network call, so a typo fails
instantly with a readable message instead of a 404. 404/401/403 are permanent
and never retried; 429 and 5xx back off exponentially and honour `Retry-After`.
`OrcidError` replaces raw `HTTPError`/`URLError` tracebacks at the boundary.

---

## INF-02 — CLI subcommand architecture

- **Priority** P0 · **Status** done · **Owner** session · **Rev** r3
- **Files** `src/orcid_biosketch/cli.py`

The CLI is a single flat command. Every feature above needs a verb.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Subcommands: `generate`, `lint`, `export`, `wrapped`, `fortune`, `badge`.
- [x] `orcid-biosketch <ORCID>` keeps working unchanged (back-compat).
- [x] Shared options factored into a common parent parser.

---

## FUN-01 — Academic Wrapped

- **Priority** P2 · **Status** done · **Owner** agent/fun · **Rev** r4
- **Files** `src/orcid_biosketch/fun.py` (new)

Spotify-style year in review: top venue, most prolific month, longest gap,
keyword drift, co-authors met for the first time. Highest shareability per line
of code in the entire backlog. Ship in December.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Terminal, JSON and shareable-card outputs.
- [x] Every statistic derived from asserted data; nothing invented.
- [x] Graceful with sparse records — a two-paper year still produces something
      kind rather than something bleak.

---

**Notes** — The card discloses its own method (gaps in months, year-only dates
counted as January, undated outputs named and excluded) so no figure is mistaken
for a claim the record does not support. Sparse years render factually, without
commentary on productivity.

---

## FUN-02 — ORCID trading card

- **Priority** P3 · **Status** done · **Owner** agent/fun · **Rev** r4

A printable stat card: years active as HP, output count as attack, a "special
ability" drawn from the record's own keywords. QR to the ORCID record.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Self-contained SVG, print-ready, no external assets.
- [x] Stats traceable to record fields.

---

## FUN-03 — Publication contribution heatmap

- **Priority** P3 · **Status** done · **Owner** agent/fun · **Rev** r4

The GitHub green-squares grid for publication dates. Instantly legible, and
quietly humane: it shows the fallow years that polished CVs hide.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Self-contained SVG, readable in light and dark contexts.
- [x] Sensible with decade-spanning records.
- [x] Include every year between the first and last dated output, including
      zero-output years.

---

## FUN-04 — Career sonification

- **Priority** P3 · **Status** planned · **Owner** — · **Rev** r1

Publication dates to notes, venues to instruments, output counts to velocity;
emit a MIDI file. "Here is what my postdoc sounds like."

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Standard MIDI written from the standard library, no dependencies.
- [ ] Deterministic: the same record always yields the same file.

---

## FUN-05 — Conference badge, vCard and email signature

- **Priority** P2 · **Status** planned · **Owner** — · **Rev** r1

Boring-useful disguised as fun, and the item people would use weekly: A6 badge
with QR and top outputs, a vCard, and an HTML email signature.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Print-ready badge at A6; QR generated without a runtime dependency.
- [ ] Valid vCard 4.0 including the ORCID iD.

---

## FUN-06 — `fortune`

- **Priority** P3 · **Status** done · **Owner** agent/fun · **Rev** r4

Print a random one of your own paper titles in your shell. Twenty lines, pure
joy.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Reads a generated biosketch; no network access at call time.
- [x] Fast enough for a shell startup file.

---

## FUN-07 — Collaborator distance · deferred

Erdős-number-style distance between two ORCID iDs via OpenAlex coauthorship.
**Deferred**: depends on KF-04's enrichment client.

## FUN-08 — Deterministic career poster · deferred

Generative art seeded from the ORCID digits and work titles; the same iD always
yields the same artwork. **Deferred**: no dependency, purely a question of
sequencing after the P0/P1 work.

## FUN-09 — Academic family tree · deferred

Chain `educations` across ORCID iDs to reconstruct advisor lineages.
**Deferred**: needs KF-07's multi-record fetching.

---

## INF-03 — Verify normalized shapes against a live ORCID record

- **Priority** P1 · **Status** planned · **Owner** — · **Rev** r1
- **Files** `tests/fixture.json`, `tests/test_core.py`

`pub.orcid.org:443` is refused by the egress proxy in the environment where
KF-01 was implemented (`CONNECT tunnel failed, 403` — a network policy denial,
not a TLS or credential problem). The KF-01 fixture is therefore derived from
ORCID's documented v3.0 schemas rather than from a real response. The parsers
are defensive and degrade to empty lists, so a shape mismatch would silently
produce empty sections rather than an error — which is exactly the failure mode
worth closing.

The 2026-09-01 review environment could reach the public API and verified the
record, work-summary, bulk-work contributor, funding-summary, and full funding
shapes. Peer-review, service, and research-resource live-shape verification
remains.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Fetch a real public record containing funding, peer review, service and
      research-resource entries from a host with ORCID egress allowed.
- [ ] Diff the live shapes against `tests/fixture.json`; correct any divergence.
- [x] Confirm whether `funding-summary` carries `amount` (feeds KF-02): it does
      not; the full funding endpoint returned `57000.0 EUR` for the live record.
- [ ] Consider a slow-marked integration test, skipped when ORCID is unreachable.

---

## INF-04 — Regenerate published outputs for schema 0.2.0

- **Priority** P1 · **Status** done · **Owner** session · **Rev** r2
- **Files** `generated/`

KF-01 raised the contract to `schema_version` 0.2.0, but `generated/biosketch.json`
in the repository still declares 0.1.0 and lacks the new sections. Anyone
validating the *published* artifact against the *published* schema therefore
fails until the outputs are regenerated. This could not be fixed in the branch:
regeneration needs a live ORCID fetch, and `pub.orcid.org` is unreachable from
the build environment (INF-03).

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Regenerate `generated/` from the live public record on schema 0.2.0.
- [x] Confirm the rebuilt `biosketch.json` validates against the 0.2.0 schema.
- [x] Confirm the web component accepts the regenerated artifact in its test.

---

## INF-05 — Enforce the biosketch contract

- **Priority** P0 · **Status** done · **Owner** session · **Rev** r2
- **Files** `schema/biosketch.schema.json`, `tests/test_core.py`

The published schema currently validates malformed list entries and untyped
provenance values that crash or mislead downstream consumers. The schema is a
runtime integration boundary, not only documentation, and must reject documents
that the Python renderers and web component cannot consume.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Define reusable schemas for dates, sources, affiliations, works and
      provenance rather than unconstrained arrays.
- [x] Reject null/scalar entries in every structured section.
- [x] Validate URI-bearing fields and required work fields.
- [x] Keep researcher-controlled extension fields possible where documented.

---

## INF-06 — Harden the web component trust boundary

- **Priority** P1 · **Status** done · **Owner** session · **Rev** r2
- **Files** `web/orcid-biosketch.js`, `tests/`

The component can load remote researcher-controlled JSON but currently assigns
record URLs directly to anchors. It also assumes that shallowly validated work
entries are objects. Treat loaded JSON as untrusted input even when it claims to
follow the biosketch schema.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Only `http:` and `https:` URLs become clickable links.
- [x] Invalid work entries cannot crash rendering or PDF export.
- [x] Attribute changes cannot let a stale fetch overwrite a newer `src`.
- [x] Add browser-facing regression tests or a deterministic testable helper.

---

## INF-07 — Cross-platform CLI and test correctness

- **Priority** P2 · **Status** done · **Owner** session · **Rev** r2
- **Files** `src/orcid_biosketch/cli.py`, `src/orcid_biosketch/core.py`,
  `tests/`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

The review found several platform and command-path inconsistencies: fixtures use
the process default encoding, custom template paths are accepted by the library
but rejected by the CLI, and missing affiliation dates are rendered as
`present`. These are small defects with visible user-facing consequences.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] All repository text fixtures are read explicitly as UTF-8.
- [x] CI covers Windows as well as Linux.
- [x] The CLI accepts custom template file paths supported by the exporter.
- [x] Missing start and end dates render no period; no output invents `present`.
- [x] `Retry-After: 0` and HTTP-date values are honoured correctly.
